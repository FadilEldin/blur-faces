# To install face_recognition run
# pip install cmake
# pip install dlib
# if fails then https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41912372/dlib-installation-on-windows-10
# i.e.
# Install Dlib from .whl
# Dlib 19.7.0
# pip install https://pypi.python.org/packages/da/06/bd3e241c4eb0a662914b3b4875fc52dd176a9db0d4a2c915ac2ad8800e9e/dlib-19.7.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl#md5=b7330a5b2d46420343fbed5df69e6a3f
# You can test it, downloading an example from the site, for example SVM_Binary_Classifier.py and running it on your machine.

# Note: if this message occurs you have to build dlib from source:
# dlib-19.7.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform
# Install Dlib from source (If the solution above doesn't work)
# Windows Dlib > 19.7.0
# Download the CMake installer and install it: https://cmake.org/download/
#----------------------------------
# Add CMake executable path to the Enviroment Variables:
# set PATH="%PATH%;C:\Program Files\CMake\bin"
# note: The path of the executable could be different from C:\Program Files\CMake\bin, just set the PATH accordingly.
# note: The path will be set temporarily, to make the change permanent you have to set it in the “Advanced system settings” → “Environment Variables” tab.
# Restart The Cmd or PowerShell window for changes to take effect.
# Download the Dlib source(.tar.gz) from the Python Package Index : https://pypi.org/project/dlib/#files extract it and enter into the folder.
# Check the Python version: python -V. This is my output: Python 3.7.2 so I'm installing it for Python3.x and not for Python2.x
# note: You can install it for both Python 2 and Python 3, if you have set different variables for different binaries i.e: python2 -V, python3 -V
# Run the installation: python setup.py install
#------------------------------------
# for ANACONDA
# Need to have the base point to python 3.9
